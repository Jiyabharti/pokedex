# Create a Pokedex

This task is to create a small app which can search for pokemon by ID or by name. We will be using a simplified version
of the Pokemon API, the [PokeAPI proxy](https://pokeapi-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/).

We will be making something similar to this in functionality, except it will be in Python: https://pokemon-search-app.freecodecamp.rocks/


## PokeAPI
- Have a look at the [PokeAPI proxy](https://pokeapi-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/) and see what kind of response you get back for different pokemon.

## Requirements
Here's a list of functional requirements to make a minimum viable product:
- The app accepts an input of a name or an id number
- When the input is entered, a request is made to the PokeAPI using this identifier
- When the pokemon is found:
  - The app displays the name and image of the Pokemon
  - The app displays some stats about the Pokemon
- When the pokemon is not found:
  - An error message appears (this can be any kind of format you choose)

## Tech stack
- You will be using Python to make this app
- You can use streamlit to make a UI
- You should use pytest for any unit tests
